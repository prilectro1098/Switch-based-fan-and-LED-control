# Switch-based-fan-and-LED-control
Created an Arduino-based LED &amp; Fan Control System using register-level programming with Timer 2. Users can control LEDs and a fan with switches, utilizing a 1-second delay for smooth toggling. A great example of my skills in embedded systems and low-level programming.
